Exercise 1 - Given the IDS dataset (Zeek), perform the task below (30% of grade):

As the dataset has a big size, generate a random sample (10% of the original dataset) to analyze.
Convert the ts field (timestamp) to the correct format (datetime64)
Display the unique ports and originator IPs.
Get the number of HTPP connections that exist in the dataset that does not run over port 80. 
Answer (example):  answer_example.png    
 

Exercise 2 - Using the same dataset, perform the following time-series analysis (30% of grade):

Build a graph where the incidence of HTTP connection packets that did not use the standard port 80 or 8080 is grouped by quarter (save the generated jpeg/png). 
Identify in the dataset the data that a connection spent more than 5 seconds. Group the information by months/year.
Given that executable types ={'application/x-dosexec', 'application/octet-stream', 'binary', 'application/vnd.ms-cab-compressed'} and the common exploit types = {'application/x-java-applet','application/pdf','application/zip','application/jar','application/x-shockwave-flash'}. Find in the dataset the packages that has the presence of this kind of problems. Group this information by quarter and build a graph to present your answer. 

Exercise 2 - Perform the following tutorial:   https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/06_calculate_statistics.html (40% of grade):

Realize some analysis in the Zeek dataset and generate a report with your finds (remember: a report has: introduction, methodology, finds, and conclusion).
